In an increasingly online world, we've become accustomed to being able to
download anything from anywhere. Usually, we never think twice about where that
download is coming from or who is on the other side, or even worse, who might
be listening in or changing things in flight. Sometimes that doesn't really
matter. Like this site. But sometimes it really matters. You *need*
to make sure you're going to your bank's website. You *need* to make sure
that you're putting your password in the real amazon.com. With the web, we use
SSL for this. It's the padlock in the upper right-hand corner of your browser
that says "Connection Secured" whenever you go anywhere these days. But how do
we secure files and make sure they were put there by someone we trust?

GPG (The GNU Privacy Guard) is a software that lets us do this. It's based on a
"web of trust" that helps to ensure that no broken, compromised, or otherwise
expired keys should ever break the trust of any other keys. That's a fancy way
of saying that it is decentralized. There's a lot of buzz about that right now!
With GPG, people generate their own Master Certifying Key, from which they can
create various sub keys to encrypt, authenticate, or sign files and messages.
The certifying key is used to sign other keys as well, which says that they
are trusted. So, if I have a friend, Bob, and we sign each other's keys, we are
saying to the whole web of trust that anything that Bob trusts, I trust,
and anything that I trust, Bob trusts. This is transitive. So if Bob also
trusts Sam the same way that I trust Bob, then I will as well. However, there's
some additional protections, where this relationship is weaker, and will
require multiple indirect relationships to be trusted, so no one link in the
chain will affect all others.

That was a lot of talk about keys, but not a lot about encryption, which is
the meat and potatoes of GPG. Keys give us the ability to encrypt, sign, and
authenticate. So let's get started.

# Generating a Master Certifying Key

1. First, we have to generate our new keys. This is best done on an
air-gapped computer that will never touch the internet again. However, this is
*not* necessary to use GPG, it just keeps your master key much more Secure
by removing the opportunity for a data leak. Use the command
`gpg --expert --full-generate-key` to generate a new key. You'll get a prompt asking you to select a key type. Select option 8 to generate an RSA key. (there are other options, but they're not as widely in use right now).
```
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.5; Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (13) Existing key
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection?
```

2. Next, the program is going to ask us
what capabilities we want for our key. We want to toggle everything off except
for `Certify`, and type q when finished.
```
Possible actions for this RSA key: Sign Certify Encrypt Authenticate
Current allowed actions: Sign Certify Encrypt

   (S) Toggle the sign capability
   (E) Toggle the encrypt capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished
```

3. Next, we have to set our key length. It's wise to make our key as long as
possible so we can be prepared for the future, but it can make encryption
slower. It depends on the key type. In my case, the longest is 4096, so I'll
select that.
```
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
```

4. Next, we need to select when the key is set to expire. I chose "never"
because I keep my key secret and air-gapped. If you don't keep your key
air-gapped, I'd advise you set some expiry date a few years in the future so
in case it gets compromised, the damage that could be done is minimal. It will ask to confirm, and you'll have to confirm your choices.
```
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)

Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N)
```

5. Next, we'll have to give it our real information. Anonymity is not really
an option here unless you have a pseudonym. I don't, so I'm using my real name
and a test email from my domain. Again, you'll be asked to confirm.
```

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Matthew Krueger
Email address: example@matthewkrueger.com
Comment: Matthew's Example Master Certifying Key for Website
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Matthew Krueger (Matthew's Example Master Certifying Key for Website) <example@matthewkrueger.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
```

6. We'll now be asked to enter a password for our master key. This is VITALLY
important if you're not keeping your key air-gapped, as this will encrypt
your key when not in use. Since this is a demo, I'm not going to enter
anything here. Every OS and implementation of GPG will be different, so follow
the prompts it gives you. Once again, I'd like to emphasize the VITAL
importance of choosing a unique, complex, and random password for your key. I
keep mine written down on a physical piece of paper that never touched a copy
machine (they spy on you), and I sent copies to my family across the state.
While that's a bit extreme, similar concepts are still good to follow,
especially offsite backups. You don't want to lose your key. Ever.

7. Lastly, GPG will generate our key and give us some information. The line
pub contains a number, `64CFA56B[...]`. That is
our key ID. This is how we identify keys. We're now ready to generate some sub
keys that we can actually use.
```
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

```

8. We can confirm our key is generated by checking our keyring. We do this by
using the command `gpg --list-keys`. Here's my keyring. If you notice, we're
missing a few things. Our key we just generated only has a C. But my real key
has three keys label `sub` below, that each have an expiry date, as well as
an S, E, and A. We'll explore these sub-keys next.
```

# Generating Subkeys

1. First, we'll get our list of keys again. Use `gpg --list-keys` for this.
Since we're working on our example key, I'll use my first selection,
`64CFA56B[...]`. We can also use the last 16
digits of this key for short this is called the keyID. (There's also a short
keyID that's the last 8 digits)

2. Next, we'll use the fingerprint to edit our key. You'll need your Master
key password at this point. Enter it when it prompts you. At this point,
we'll be in a terminal for GPG. We can ask it for help with `help`!
`gpg --expert --edit-key <your key>` is the command we need for this
operation.

3. Now, that's a lot of stuff. But what we're mainly interested in is adding
a subkey to this. If we check the help page, this is under the `addkey`
command. Type that in, and then enter option 8 for an RSA subkey.
This should look pretty similar, as we're just repeating the process of
generating a new key, and we'll follow the same exact steps.
```
gpg> addkey
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (5) Elgamal (encrypt only)
   (6) RSA (encrypt only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (12) ECC (encrypt only)
  (13) Existing key
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection?
```

4. Follow the steps as above, toggling everything off but `sign`. You'll
notice the option for `certify` isn't here. Only Master keys can certify.
We'll also want 4096 bit security. Expiry wise, these are more likely to be
useful expiring after a year or so. I have mine set to expire after 3 years
since I keep my keys on a FIPS hardware security key (something I'll cover in
a later post). I'd advise around a year. Make sure to set a password for this
key as well. This is VITALLY important just as with the main key. Since this
is a demo key, I am not going to be adding one here.
```

Possible actions for this RSA key: Sign Encrypt Authenticate
Current allowed actions: Sign

   (S) Toggle the sign capability
   (E) Toggle the encrypt capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished

Your selection?

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 1y
Key expires at Thu May  1 02:04:32 2025 EDT
Is this correct? (y/N) y
Really create? (y/N) y
```

5. Repeat this process, toggling everything but `encrypt` on the second key,
and everything but `Authenticate` on the third. After this is complete, you
should see an output that looks like below. Type `save` to save the keys.
```

6. Now we're done! We have GPG keys in our keyring. We'll talk about
offloading these keys to physical security keys later, as well as talk about
how to actually use the keys to do cool things like encrypting and decrypting
messages. We'll also upload our key to a keyserver.
