## Rust as an AI Tool
AI has long been dominated by slow languages such as Python, or wildly unsafe
languages such as C and C++ since the idea of creating an artificial intelligence
first crossed into our minds. But there's a new language on the block. One with
memory safety like Python that can avoid data corruption, but with the speed
of C and C++ to perform the heavy calculations we need. This language is RUST!
We already know some about Rust in the AI space. For example, xAI's Grok is
built in Rust for example. But what about Rust's other capabilities?
