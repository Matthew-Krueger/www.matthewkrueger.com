## About
This is the underlying hugo code for www.matthewkrueger.com

## Requirements
This requires GIT-LFS due to the fact that I am storing files in here.

## Published vs Non-Published articles
Published articles will not have the draft in the frontmatter. Draft articles
will have `draft: true` in the front matter as this suppresses the generation of
their hugo page. These articles may or may not be committed to the repository
and draft articles are not guaranteed to be published.

## Free Software Used
 - Debian 12 Software Stack (various licenses)
 - Nginx (BSD 2 Clause)
 - OpenSSL (Apache 2.0)
 - CertBot (Apache 2.0)
 - Hugo (Apache 2.0)
 - hugo-theme-stack (GPL)
